# 🧬 NovaGen Health Risk Classification

## 📌 Overview

This project builds a machine learning model to classify individuals as **Healthy** or **Unhealthy** using health data.
The goal is to support clinical research and risk analysis.

---

## 🎯 Objective

* Train and compare multiple classification models
* Select the best model based on **recall** (important in healthcare)

---

## 🗂️ Dataset

* **Target = 0 → Healthy**
* **Target = 1 → Unhealthy**
* Dataset is anonymized and used for learning purposes.

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib, Seaborn

---

## 🧪 Models Used

* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* Gradient Boosting
* Voting Classifier
* Stacking Classifier

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1 Score

> Recall is prioritized because missing an unhealthy person can be risky in healthcare.

---

## 🏆 Best Model

**Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** performed the best based on recall.

* **Recall:** 94.26%
* **Accuracy:** 93.35%
* **F1 Score:** 93.75%
